# React Native workshop by [Ivan Iankovskyi](https://github.com/AtticusFetch)

- [x] Bootstrap the app
- [x] Add navigation with 1 basic screen
- [x] Setup tab navigation with blank tabs
- [x] On the first screen we will implement the Feed component
- [x] Initially, feed shows just 1 button: Find Stuff
- [x] This is because we have a limited amount of requests
- [x] When button is pressed - we show a spinner (default) and fetch initial set of movies (page 1, search apple)
- [x] Save data to local storage ([<page_num>]: [result])
- [x] Before doing a fetch - check for data in the storage
- [x] For this - we need to store current page somewhere in state
- [x] For now we will have only 1 there
- [x] Use the API to fetch the items (1-2-3 is enough to fill the screen)
- [x] Pick the view for the feed component
- [x] Fill it with data
- [x] Create markup components for data
- [x] Add onEndReached callback
- [x] Check for data in storage
- [x] If no data - fetch
- [x] Store new data
- [x] Push new data to the current results count
- [x] Increment page number in state
- [x] Configure threshold
- [x] Let’s create our own animated spinner
- [ ] Let’s add the animation of the feed sliding down when rendered initially
- [ ] Let’s create the details page component on the second screen
- [ ] For now we will hardcode it to use first film in the storage
- [ ] Fetch details by id
- [ ] Add a Website link that will shows action menu with options to open browser or in-app web view
- [ ] Create markup and style this page
- [ ] Now let’s change our feed screen to a stack navigator and place details page there
- [ ] Add animation where poster shrinks as user scrolls so that is always visible, but after 50% it starts to fade out
- [ ] Let’s add a second screen
- [ ] It will show top rated movies from whatever is in storage
- [ ] It will look like a horizontal carousel
- [ ] Underneath it it will render the current movie description and its rating
- [ ] Create a search bar on the feed screen
- [ ] Do search on keyboard return
- [ ] Use provided value with search api
- [ ] Add the ability to enter a year with a native select component (like a search but simpler)
- [ ] Do the new search
- [ ] Save data as [year_apple]: [result]
- [ ] Check the second screen
- [ ] Create third screen
- [ ] Two buttons here: upload video, upload photo
- [ ] Place the content on top
- [ ] https://www.companyshop.co.uk/company-shop/news-and-enquiries/news-centre/company-shop-joins-london-stock-exchanges-inaugural-elite-programme/
- [ ] When user taps on content - it shows in full screen modal
